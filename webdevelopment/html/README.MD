# HTML basics
## HTML document
- all HTML documents start with the type declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- the document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>` - wich applies to most HTML commands
- the visible part of the HTML document is nested in the body - between `<body>` and `</body>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Header 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## HTML body

## Forms
