# UIViewController

> An object that manages a view hierarchy for your UIKit app.

**Declaration**

```swift
class UIViewController : UIResponder
```

**Main responsibilities**
- *update* the contents of the view, usually in response the *changes to the underlying data*
- responding to *user interactions*
- *resizing* views
- *managing* the layout of the overall interface
- *coordinating* with other objects in an app

**Basics**
- view controllers are *UIResponder* objects
- inserted into the *responder chain* between view controller's root view and that view's superview (typically belongs to another view controller)
- you often use multiple view controllers, each owning a portion of the app's user interface
```markdown
For example, one view controller might display a table of items while a different view 
controller displays the selected item from that table.
```

## View Management
- each view controller manages a *view hierarchy* (the root view is stored in view property)
- the root view acts as a *container* for the rest of the view hierarchy
- several ways to specify the views for a view controller: 
  1. specify the view controller and its views in the *storyboard*; to load a view controller from a storyboard, call 
  ```swift
  instantiateViewController(withIdentifier:)
  ```
  2. specify using a Nib file; a Nib file lets you specify the views of a single view controller, but doesn't let you define segues or relationships; create the vc programmatically and initialize using `init(nibName:bundle:)`
  3. specify the views using the `loadView()` method; 
- a view controller's root view is always sized to fit its assigned space

## Handling View-Related Notifications
- when the visibility of its views changes, a vc automatically calls its own methods so that subclasses can respond
- `viewWillAppear(_:)` can be used to prepare your views to appear onscreen, and `viewWillDisappear(_:)` can be used to save changes or other state information

- the above image shows the possible visible states for a view controller's views
- not all *will* callback methods are paired with only a *did* callback method 
- if you start a *will* callback method, you need to close it with the corresponding *did* and the opposite *will* callback method

## Handling View Rotations
- rotations are treated as a change in the size of the vc's view
- are reported using the ```viewWillTransition(to:with:)``` method

```interface orientation changes -> UIKit calls viewWillTransition(to:with:) on window's root vc -> root vc notifies its child vcs -> propagating the view through vc hierarchy```

- use ```prefferedInterfaceOrientationForPresentation``` for a vc that is intended to be full screen in a specific orientation
- methods that are called during a rotation:
	- `willRotate(to:duration:)`
	- `willAnimateRotation(to:duration:)`
	- `didRotate(from:)`
	- `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` is called after the view is resized and positioned by its parent
	- if a vc is not visible when an orientation change occurs, the rotation methods are never called
	- `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method is called when the view becomes visible

## Implementing a Container View Controller
- a custom UIViewController subclass can also act as a *container* vc
- a container vc manages the presentation of content of other vc it owns (child vcs)
- your container vc should declare a *public interface* to associate its children
- a container vc must associate a child vc with itself before adding the child's root view to the view hierarchy
- essential methods:
	- `addChild(_:)`
	- `removeFromParent()`
	- `willMove(toParent:)`
	- `didMove(toParent:)`

## Memory Management
- vcs provide built-in support for reducing their memory footprint at critical times
- UIViewController class provides automatic handling of low-memory conditions through `didReceiveMemeoryWarning()` method

## State Preservation and Restoration
- when a value is assigned to the `restorationIdentifier` property, the system may ask the vc to encode itself when the app transitions in the background
- a vc preserves the state of any views in its view hierarchy that also have restoration identifiers
- if a custom view controller is implemented, any child view controller must be encoded by yourself
- each child must have a unique restoration identifier
