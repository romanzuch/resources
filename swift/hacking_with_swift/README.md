# Hacking with Swift by twostraws
## Review Projects 1 -3 

- the app (project 1) and the game (project 2) were built with UIKit
- UIKit will be used for two more milestones
- things we learned and used from UIKit:
	- table views using UITableView
	- image views using UIImageView, as well as the data inside, UIImage
	- buttons using UIButton
	- view controllers using UIViewController
	- system alerts using UIAlertController
	- navigation bar buttons using UIBarButtonItem
	- colors using UIColor
	- sharing content with UIActivityViewController
- relationship between `CALayer` <> `UIView` and `CGColor` <> `UIColor` might be confusing for now
- important Interface Builder things I've met so far:
	- storyboards
	- outlets and action from IB
	- Auto Layout
- three basic concepts I've met additionally:
	- `Bundle` class
	- `FileManager` class
	- `Int.random(in:)`
